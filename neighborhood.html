                  <p style="font-size: 20px">33. I'm not going to lie, I was super excited to get to finally try the FSD Beta to see what progress had been made through these years of waiting. When I finally got the build pushed to my car I took it for a daily commute to the gym. Here's how it went. The profile is on Assertive btw. Driving through the neighborhood I understand it treats it as any other road but the car travels literally in the middle of the road so I have to disable it until I get out of neighborhood. Turning out of neighborhood the creep is so slow and when it finally decides to go after sitting for a little while with no cars coming, it's just too slow. Here's where I was pretty impressed at the 4 way stop sign, it does really well at detected when it's turn is but again it's commitment to go is just way to slow so I find myself always on the acceleration pedal to speed it along before someone honks at me. When entering a 2 lane left turn, it chose the one on the very left and what shocked me was it committed too hard and fast this time yanking me into the furthest lane. It then failed to correctly make the turn though. It also failed to make the turn at the light to my gym but that turn is a bit hard because of how sharp it is. I drive this commute every single day so I hope to see FSD grow enough to where I can actually babysit it and not intervene every second. I just wanted to share my experience with it and a bit of my disappointment as I've had FSD for around 3 years now.</p>

                     <p>Agree with everything you said. In addition to the center of the road neighborhood driving it goes too fast and accelerates too fast. I’ve tried all 3 settings and it turns and accelerates way too fast a lot. We have a lot of 45-50mph roads with 90 degree turns onto a 25mph road. It usually thinks hey it’s 100 yards away I better speed up and then at the last second take the turn at 40. It’s just way too aggressive when it needs to chill and way to chill when it needs to be aggressive. Blinking yellows freak it out too. Also has some weird turn behavior where it doesn’t use the turn signal all the time for me.</p><hr>
                     <p>Nope. I got the FSD Beta yesterday and it is rough. Tried to ram through a community gate at 30mph. Stopped and stalled out making an unprotected left turn. And just in general drives very very poorly in even the most basic of situations. I can see why they delayed pushing it out so long, but I am curious just how terrible the v8 and v9 FSD beta was if these are the orders of magnitude improvements we're seeing now because at this rate we'll need about 50 more of them before this thing matches regular autopilot.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sometimes I’m impressed by how it handles a straight and regular city street. Most times I am extremely mind bogglingly frustrated by how it decided to handle anything but a straight and regular street. I get that it’s beta, 100%, but this thing is not ready one bit. My recommendation to Tesla is to keep the beta group right where it’s at size-wise for 5-10 updates. With the NHTSA hot after regulation, this is not going to end well for Tesla or Tesla consumers if they keep expanding. I realized through the past few weeks of pain and torment w/ SS and now beta access that I bought the car because I like to zip around and genuinely love the tech it is really great at. I won’t be renewing my subscription come November.

It brakes well before a stop sign and then takes 5-7 seconds deciding if it wants to keep going, or stop and wait for any incoming cars. Cause the cars behind you to surely think you’re crazy. It also just missed a whole turn. I see why Elon is nervous about going wide with this release.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">35. So, I just did a little trip tonight with little to no traffic. We SERIOUSLY need some guidance from the FSD engineering team about what sorts of things they want us to report. WHAT DO THEY WANT TO KNOW? For example, the car turned into a bike lane and drove in it for a little bit before figuring out it wasn't supposed to be there and it very abruptly moved into the correct lane. I was too busy minding the car to push the "report" icon. On residential streets with no center stripe the car drove right down the center, even when cars come at you the other way, FSD had a hard time with that. It did our roundabout in town, but only after stopping and thinking about it for a while and then proceeded with "great haste" to get through it. Unacceptable if there were any other cars on the road. Then it gave up driving over our Otowi bridge. Two lanes were closed off for bridge repairs and the cones directed us into the "wrong lane" (which was set up for 2 way traffic) and it freaked out and gave up. All of these incidents are interesting and reportable I think... but do they want to hear about ALL of them? I dare not take my hands off the wheel or eyes off the road to push the little report icon every time. It's all very very cool and I want to be a useful beta tester but I need some advice on how to best report all these things. I did send a report Email tonight and asked this very question. I'll post here if I get some good feedback.</p>

                     <p>Yes! That’s a great way to describe it. Though my experience was a residential road the car drove down the middle. With on coming traffic the car did indeed move over to the right side in time, but it did feel a little like a game of chicken and could tell the other car was slowing a bit. Heck made me a nervous too.. If it would have stayed to the right side of the road a bit more it probably wouldn’t have felt that way and not noticeable. We’re talking about 6 ft here so just that bit on a residential road does make me feel extra cautious and ready for the take over.</p><hr>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">37. My experience is that it feels like the car is driving too close to the center of the road on unmarked neighborhood streets. That is because I'm used to driving closer to the right edge of the road in such situations. However, looking at the visualization, the car is driving in the center of its half of the road. Just feels strange, particularly going around curves. My car also moves closer to the right side of the road when necessary. For example, when a big truck is coming from the opposite direction.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">38. I’m in! Got the FSD beta downloaded and installed Yesterday morning! First drive was very good, even impressed the Mrs. For those who are waiting, I think I was a late first batch my score was 99 going into last Friday, but by Sunday night I was at 100. After a few takeovers and a ding for Autopilot disengagement (my passenger was FaceTiming during the drive, interior camera A.I. detected the phone and disengaged after 3 warnings, I kept rotating the steering wheel thinking it was checking if I was holding it, but it was due to the phone) my score was 99 late in the afternoon, by evening my safety score checking ability was removed from my app. No doubt the data is still being recorded by Tesla I enabled the enhanced FSD view in the settings, but in order for it to show you need to tap the compass top right corner of the map. This mornings ride was great, a couple jerky right turns, I think its the cars inability to see the lane markings clearly through the whole curve. Car bounced between a couple unnecessary lane changes before getting itself into the correct lane, downtown driving was smoother, probably due to the lower speed. FSD performs much better at lower speed, I have my AP speed limit offset set to -1, I use the scroll wheel constantly to adjust speed up or down, depending of my confidence level. I did notice a degradation in performance (A.I. confidence) during drives when the sun was low in the sky, shadows or glare may have something to do with that. One last point, may have been discussed, FSD does not recognize neighborhood entry gates, just a heads up.Looks as the 99’s will get the 10.3 soon, I’m looking forward to seeing what incremental improvements come with the next updates.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">39. 10.3 FSD! This is sooooo much better than autopilot on city streets! Pros: smooth lane changes, speed setting to flow with traffic rather than +5 limit, shy away from bicyclists, no more fiddling with continuing through green lights, no more fiddling with autopilot because a turn is upcoming, just a more natural drive (minus the cons below), good slowing for speed bumps, probably more I forgot Cons: difficulty choosing the correct lane in a timely manner for some turns, need to goose the accelerator sometimes for turns, now I have to deal with bad map data, figuring out how best to take turns on the unmarked, no curb, roads in my neighborhood (some "drunk driving" action there. I can readily imagine getting pulled over if there were cops around)</p>
