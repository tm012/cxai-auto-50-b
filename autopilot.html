When I left the gym after a couple of hours, it went bonkers. Autopilot would not engage. Once I turned off FSD, I could use AutoPilot for a few seconds then got the red steering wheel take over now message. I had several very hard emergency braking sessions on the freeway. I got a notification to install new software (turned out to be the previous version (2021.36.5.1). When I got home to install it, it said it wasn't available. I rebooted several times and tried most every combination of settings. Waiting patiently for a fix so I can safely drive again.</p>

                     <p>TEMP FIX found, Turn off sentry mode before you go into drive. That worked for me. So I believe that it works for most people in the morning because they have sentry mode off at home location. And their 2nd drive it starts being buggy because sentry is on before going into drive mode. Is sentry mode set to off at home for you?</p><hr>
                     <p>I turned off sentry mode and emergency braking. Rebooted the car. Took it out for a nice drive and everything seems to be working normally again.</p><hr>
                     <p>I would leave emergency breaking on. I have it in and several others have as well and itâ€™s working fine. Just make sure sentry is off until they issue and update to fix it.</p><hr>

So I've been seeing a lot of people talking about their experiences in very hyperbolic ways, good and bad, but I feel like a lot of the bad is from misaligned expectations. Having now used the beta for a while and driven hundreds of miles on all my daily routes, and being very satisfied with it despite its problems I though I'd share why I feel that way. In doing so I hope to help others who have either just gotten or will soon get the beta have the best experience. First and foremost remember that despite the name this is NOT FSD. This is City Streets, and a beta at that. The goal with this step is not to make your car autonomous, but to enhance its existing capabilities to be much more useful off highway. Think of it as NoA for off highway. With that expectation I suspect you will have a much better time dear reader, because it will affect how you interact with the system. For example: Rather than expecting the car to simply get you from point A to B without your input, think of it as trying to reduce your workload. With turns from stops I can focus on looking for cars and making sure the car waits for and gets the right gap rather than worrying about creeping into someone coming the other way. With turns off roads I can focus on making sure the car gets the angle right rather than worrying about braking. What AP did for going straight, this does for taking turns. It will mess up, but the point isn't that it will do things for you, its that you can focus on making sure it does it right rather than doing it right yourself. If you felt comfortable using public AP and knew how to handle it well, you'll be fine. The mental workload is honestly no worse. (Hell for me personally, the roads, and amount of turns I take, it's less) That said, roads where you couldn't use AP before can be rough. Unmarked roads in particular require attention as it likes to hug the center until there's a car coming and it's relatively close. Thing is, if markings fade or are washed out by the sun it can treat them the same too. But so long as you watch out, and put in the energy you're really supposed to be putting in with public AP you'll be okay. And as long as you remember that this is supposed to be NoA off highway, you'll have a good time. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p>

                     <p>My only complaint is the lane centering when on side streets that arent marked. The car will straddle the center line until another car is so close that the owner has to be really freaked out. If it understands where objects are and how to center itself it has to be an offset change to make it move further over to the right side of the road. Where it should be. Everything beyond this is excusable as the general turning errors feel as if it's learning but messing up, lane centering is something that I know tesla has done before (moving over in the lane when passing large vehicles) so I can't excuse it and is honestly responsible for 90%+ of my disengagement.</p><hr>
                     <p>That centering also occurs in two lane highways with extra unmarked lanes for parked cars. It drives down the center of the 2 right lanes, swerves left for each parked car then centers itself the same way. It's a bit unnerving.</p><hr>
                     <p>Not just that, but there is some pretty dangerous behavior at stop signs / stop lights on the small streets we have on the west side of LA. Right up against the curb there is a lane for cars to parallel and it is separated from traffic by a solid line: https://i.imgur.com/1u15bnX.png When you are pulling up to a stop the solid line turns to dashed lines and that lane becomes a turn lane for the stop since cars are not allowed to park there. FSD doesn't know how to handle that though and tries to make a turn from the main lane, which is not what the other drivers on the road / pedestrians would expect a turning car to do and could cause issues
</p>
<hr>
<p>I want to agree with you, but my experience with FSD beta is that it doesn't reduce my workload at all. If anything, it increases my workload, anxiety, and stress of driving. Now I don't mind that because I knew what I was signing up for, but where AP and NoA are genuinely useful tools to reduce workload, FSD is far from that and is ready at any moment to cause an accident. I really wanted FSD beta to be like NoA for city streets, but in my experience, I feel like an unpaid alpha tester. Again, I sort of expected this, but I don't want people to have an expectation that FSD beta is anything like NoA or normal AP. Those are useful tools to reduce workload. FSD beta increases mental load, stress, and anxiety while using it in hopes that our testing efforts will one day bring a truly useful tool to the masses.
</p><hr>


<p>For me, FSD beta is way more jerky and stressful on straight / curvy drives vs standard ap. Occasionally FSD outright dies (with the 'autopilot cameras unavailable' error) and I can't even use regular AP until I deep reset the car.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">3. The Navigate on Autopilot that's in the FSD Beta 10.2 is the same as the one that's in the pure vision cars. It's not really the beginning of single stack as much as slightly different logic using the same mechanisms. I've observed an issue with lane changing where if you're on a three lane highway and you're in the far right lane, and someone is in the far left lane, and the center lane is empty, the car repeatedly has issues telling whether the vehicle in the far left lane is in fact in the left lane. I initiated a lane change to the center lane and the car aborted back to the right lane because the car in the left most lane "drifted" into the center lane. The car in the far left never "drifted", the car simply misjudged it and aborted it. When on FSD Beta you're basically using the "bare minimum" autopilot that the Pure Vision folks got when they took the radar out. I will say that when the lane changes do work its much more smooth than when the radar was in play. The only real comparison I can give is that radar based lane changing felt more programmatic, in that you would start to signal, the car would validate that it could change lanes, change lanes, then go back to "Normal autopilot". Now you turn the signal on and it just goes over. It doesn't feel like a program's subroutine just kicked in to perform a task. But there's no "single stack" in play here yet, it's just that you're seeing tasks performed without the radar now. Go Google up some videos of the Vision only vehicles doing their thing and you'll see the behavior is still the same, it's just that now we're seeing vision car stuff.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">4. OK, I received FSD beta, and it was accompanied by an email about it. I had a 100 safety score, but not a perfect 100 score. I drove to the health club this morning (about a 10 minute drive) and then to work (about 15 minutes) using it. It did a lot better than I thought. On my first drive I couldn't engage it from my driveway, but I drove into the street in front of my driveway, and it drove me all the way to the roundabout at the club with no disengagements. Traffic was light, but I was impressed. It accelerated and braked a lot harder than I would have, but nothing unsafe. On the drive to work, it also did a fine job. There were only three things it did that were unusual. There was a stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet or so, and a side street to my left. It stopped 50 feet short and then said creeping up. The car that was at the stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet then moved forward, and so did my car to the stop sign. There was nobody behind me so I didn't disengage. There was also a time when I was at a stoplight and turning right onto a busy 3 lane highway. It crept forward, and although I would have gone, it continued to wait. I touched the accelerator to make the car go, and it did the rest of the route just fine. I probably didn't have to press the accelerator, but I didn't want to wait. It was creeping up to a stop sign, and someone stepped off the curb into the crosswalk ahead of me. It braked fairly hard (even though it was going less than 5MPH) and stopped short a few feet in front of the stop sign, even though it could have gone up to the marker safely. I guess better safe than sorry.It stopped AutoPilot at the street in front of work instead of going into the parking lot (the address entered was the official street address on the main street) so that seems right. There were no safety interventions, and like I said I was pretty impressed. I can see how incremental refinements will just make this better and better.</p>
