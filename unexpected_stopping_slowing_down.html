                  <p style="font-size: 20px">66. I had the same experience. Funny. I drove my first ever FSD trip to the gym (about 13 miles) and FSD worked fine. When I left the gym after a couple of hours, it went bonkers. Autopilot would not engage. Once I turned off FSD, I could use AutoPilot for a few seconds then got the red steering wheel take over now message. I had several very hard emergency braking sessions on the freeway. I got a notification to install new software (turned out to be the previous version (2021.36.5.1). When I got home to install it, it said it wasn't available. I rebooted several times and tried most every combination of settings. Waiting patiently for a fix so I can safely drive again.</p>

                     <p>TEMP FIX found, Turn off sentry mode before you go into drive. That worked for me. So I believe that it works for most people in the morning because they have sentry mode off at home location. And their 2nd drive it starts being buggy because sentry is on before going into drive mode. Is sentry mode set to off at home for you?</p><hr>
                     <p>I turned off sentry mode and emergency braking. Rebooted the car. Took it out for a nice drive and everything seems to be working normally again.</p><hr>
                     <p>I would leave emergency breaking on. I have it in and several others have as well and it’s working fine. Just make sure sentry is off until they issue and update to fix it.</p><hr>

It’s horrible- not smooth, false warnings, doesn’t slow down for tight turns but slows down for no reason. If beta is good it should replace the public build which is not safe around town, in my opinion.</p>

                     <p>There is no public build for around-town use. It’s for limited-access roads and handles intersections only cursorily by means of obeying traffic controls only. Use it correctly and it’ll save you stress over thousands of miles of driving, as many of us will attest.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sorry for any confusion. I have the standard FSD, not the beta. I signed up for the beta and to provide input on my driving I’m using FSD much more than normal. I love it on the highway but on local roads I find it very unpleasant. When you mentioned turns I don’t mean turns at intersections. I mean curvy roads. When I’m driving 45 and the road has a tight bend ahead I slow down. But in my experience FSD doesn’t. My impression is that beta does slow down more like what a driver would do. I hope that clarifies.</p><hr>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">68. I'm not going to lie, I was super excited to get to finally try the FSD Beta to see what progress had been made through these years of waiting. When I finally got the build pushed to my car I took it for a daily commute to the gym. Here's how it went. The profile is on Assertive btw. Driving through the neighborhood I understand it treats it as any other road but the car travels literally in the middle of the road so I have to disable it until I get out of neighborhood. Turning out of neighborhood the creep is so slow and when it finally decides to go after sitting for a little while with no cars coming, it's just too slow. Here's where I was pretty impressed at the 4 way stop sign, it does really well at detected when it's turn is but again it's commitment to go is just way to slow so I find myself always on the acceleration pedal to speed it along before someone honks at me. When entering a 2 lane left turn, it chose the one on the very left and what shocked me was it committed too hard and fast this time yanking me into the furthest lane. It then failed to correctly make the turn though. It also failed to make the turn at the light to my gym but that turn is a bit hard because of how sharp it is. I drive this commute every single day so I hope to see FSD grow enough to where I can actually babysit it and not intervene every second. I just wanted to share my experience with it and a bit of my disappointment as I've had FSD for around 3 years now.</p>

                     <p>Agree with everything you said. In addition to the center of the road neighborhood driving it goes too fast and accelerates too fast. I’ve tried all 3 settings and it turns and accelerates way too fast a lot. We have a lot of 45-50mph roads with 90 degree turns onto a 25mph road. It usually thinks hey it’s 100 yards away I better speed up and then at the last second take the turn at 40. It’s just way too aggressive when it needs to chill and way to chill when it needs to be aggressive. Blinking yellows freak it out too. Also has some weird turn behavior where it doesn’t use the turn signal all the time for me.</p><hr>
                     <p>Nope. I got the FSD Beta yesterday and it is rough. Tried to ram through a community gate at 30mph. Stopped and stalled out making an unprotected left turn. And just in general drives very very poorly in even the most basic of situations. I can see why they delayed pushing it out so long, but I am curious just how terrible the v8 and v9 FSD beta was if these are the orders of magnitude improvements we're seeing now because at this rate we'll need about 50 more of them before this thing matches regular autopilot.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sometimes I’m impressed by how it handles a straight and regular city street. Most times I am extremely mind bogglingly frustrated by how it decided to handle anything but a straight and regular street. I get that it’s beta, 100%, but this thing is not ready one bit. My recommendation to Tesla is to keep the beta group right where it’s at size-wise for 5-10 updates. With the NHTSA hot after regulation, this is not going to end well for Tesla or Tesla consumers if they keep expanding. I realized through the past few weeks of pain and torment w/ SS and now beta access that I bought the car because I like to zip around and genuinely love the tech it is really great at. I won’t be renewing my subscription come November.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">69. OK, I received FSD beta, and it was accompanied by an email about it. I had a 100 safety score, but not a perfect 100 score. I drove to the health club this morning (about a 10 minute drive) and then to work (about 15 minutes) using it. It did a lot better than I thought. On my first drive I couldn't engage it from my driveway, but I drove into the street in front of my driveway, and it drove me all the way to the roundabout at the club with no disengagements. Traffic was light, but I was impressed. It accelerated and braked a lot harder than I would have, but nothing unsafe. On the drive to work, it also did a fine job. There were only three things it did that were unusual. There was a stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet or so, and a side street to my left. It stopped 50 feet short and then said creeping up. The car that was at the stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet then moved forward, and so did my car to the stop sign. There was nobody behind me so I didn't disengage. There was also a time when I was at a stoplight and turning right onto a busy 3 lane highway. It crept forward, and although I would have gone, it continued to wait. I touched the accelerator to make the car go, and it did the rest of the route just fine. I probably didn't have to press the accelerator, but I didn't want to wait. It was creeping up to a stop sign, and someone stepped off the curb into the crosswalk ahead of me. It braked fairly hard (even though it was going less than 5MPH) and stopped short a few feet in front of the stop sign, even though it could have gone up to the marker safely. I guess better safe than sorry.It stopped AutoPilot at the street in front of work instead of going into the parking lot (the address entered was the official street address on the main street) so that seems right. There were no safety interventions, and like I said I was pretty impressed. I can see how incremental refinements will just make this better and better.</p>

I am extremely fortunate that when FSD broke hard for reasons yet to be deduced, he didn't rear-end me but probably thinks I brake-checked him on purpose (I don't brake-check people with my baby). So far, it is WAY more stressful than trying to maintain a 100 score in the software. Learning curve I hope...</p>

It brakes well before a stop sign and then takes 5-7 seconds deciding if it wants to keep going, or stop and wait for any incoming cars. Cause the cars behind you to surely think you’re crazy. It also just missed a whole turn. I see why Elon is nervous about going wide with this release.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">72. I had pretty low expectations and knew it would struggle in my urban neighborhood, but this reminds me a lot of Smart Summon. Pretty painful to use, and not sure that I’ll be showing this to anyone. I had somewhere around 15 disengagements in less than 5 miles, but it was some of the smaller things that were the most annoying. Driving down a street with traffic lights every 5-10 blocks, it would slow ~2 mph at almost every side street without a light. And turn signals! It put them on multiple times when the road just goes around a bend, or at a four way stop when going straight ahead at just a slight angle. Really confusing to other drivers who thought I was going to turn onto a different street. Takes forever at stop signs, but that’s easy enough to goose with the accelerator. One thing it did do really well and confidently was a lane change from right to left when approaching a bus stopped in the right lane.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">73. So, I just did a little trip tonight with little to no traffic. We SERIOUSLY need some guidance from the FSD engineering team about what sorts of things they want us to report. WHAT DO THEY WANT TO KNOW? For example, the car turned into a bike lane and drove in it for a little bit before figuring out it wasn't supposed to be there and it very abruptly moved into the correct lane. I was too busy minding the car to push the "report" icon. On residential streets with no center stripe the car drove right down the center, even when cars come at you the other way, FSD had a hard time with that. It did our roundabout in town, but only after stopping and thinking about it for a while and then proceeded with "great haste" to get through it. Unacceptable if there were any other cars on the road. Then it gave up driving over our Otowi bridge. Two lanes were closed off for bridge repairs and the cones directed us into the "wrong lane" (which was set up for 2 way traffic) and it freaked out and gave up. All of these incidents are interesting and reportable I think... but do they want to hear about ALL of them? I dare not take my hands off the wheel or eyes off the road to push the little report icon every time. It's all very very cool and I want to be a useful beta tester but I need some advice on how to best report all these things. I did send a report Email tonight and asked this very question. I'll post here if I get some good feedback.</p>

I’ve found that sometimes you just have to tap the accelerator pedal to coax it along when it gets too timid or just sits in place like it doesn’t know what to do.</p>

                     <p>Remember that the reason why we're testing is to get more experiences in front of the software. I'm not surprised that my 15 mile roundtrip from our apartment in Fishers IN to Geist and back was filled with brake checks, poor lane choices and such. Interspersed with those were moments of sheer brillance. We're testers collecting more data to make FSD better. Those improvements will speed up as more data comes in with 1000+ more testers.</p><hr>
                     <p>It will be interesting to see if FSD gets better even without a software update. Tesla said in the past that our "driving mishaps " would be crunched up by its software and resulting AI improvements downloaded to the fleet.</p><hr>

Where I live, highway 160 south terminates at highway 4 where onramps will take you east or west on HW4. Each of these ramps has traffic control lights right before it puts you on the freeway. About 1000 feet before these traffic control lights, there are warning lights that will flash if traffic control is activated. 99% of the time I go through this, there is no traffic control so those warning lights are not lit. Until I just deactivated "traffic light and stop sign control", Ginger would phantom brake there EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm overly-ecstatic to report NOT ANYMORE!!!😀 IMO, future software updates should automatically turn that feature off as soon as you flip the switch for FSD. How do we make this happen?

Phantom braking is absolutely bonkers now and lasts MUCH longer. Was driving on a 50mph road and it slowed down to 35mph (speed limit and setting still showed 50mph). Stayed at 35mph for about 10sec and then went back to 50mph. It also has HORRIBLE routing. Often when there's an upcoming left turn it'd get in the right lane when there's <.5mi to go. Then immediately freak out about not being able to get in the left lane to make the turn</p>

It failed to turn on a road with high speed traffic approaching despite no visibility issues. There was plenty of time to pull out but it didn't. It had a lot of trouble knowing where to drive due to some wide roads with no markings. I had to adjust the speed quite a bit. It got too close to one car on a turn and either bailed or I tugged too hard. The turns are not natural and it tended to start turning the opposite direction like it needed to make a really wide turn but it didn't. It also over accelerates in most cases after a turn. For the most part it got from point A to point B and there were some positives with giving peds space and stopping at all the stop signs.</p>

Pros: smooth lane changes, speed setting to flow with traffic rather than +5 limit, shy away from bicyclists, no more fiddling with continuing through green lights, no more fiddling with autopilot because a turn is upcoming, just a more natural drive (minus the cons below), good slowing for speed bumps, probably more I forgot Cons: difficulty choosing the correct lane in a timely manner for some turns, need to goose the accelerator sometimes for turns, now I have to deal with bad map data, figuring out how best to take turns on the unmarked, no curb, roads in my neighborhood (some "drunk driving" action there. I can readily imagine getting pulled over if there were cops around)</p>

My main issues are how much it hugs the yellow line (not very safe or comfortable on a 2-lane road where there are frequent semi trucks), and for some reason it brakes almost every time an oncoming car approaches, even when they're fully in their lane and off toward the shoulder.</p>

                     <p>If there is no oncoming traffic, I get closer to the yellow line, especially if there is limited visibility on the sides (trees, etc.). It would give you more chance to avoid a deer if it jumps onto the road. On a slower suburban road, I also drive closer to the middle in case there is a random kid popping out. Even when driving under the low speedlimit. Obviously when there is a car approaching, I make room (and may even slow down more depending on the situation)</p><hr>
