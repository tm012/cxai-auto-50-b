As more people get enrolled into the FSD Beta Program, here are a few (serious) limitations I wish I was aware before my first drive: It doesn't yet recognize speed bumps. Be prepared to brake. It nearly never responds correctly to blinking yellow lights and might jam on the brakes very hard in response. Be prepared to hit the accelerator. EDIT: 10.3 seems to have fixed this. I'm still boing to be more cautious around them, but then that's what a blinking yellow means, anyway! It doesn't seem to handle non-standard speed limit signs at all. I have many yellow speed limit signs around schools and curves in my area. Be prepared to slow down. Turns work great like 60-70% of the time. Maybe more. For the rest, be prepared to take over or give it a tap of the accelerator. Be ready to take over anytime you encounter construction or odd traffic conditions like non-90 degree intersections, railroad tracks, or anything that looks unusual. It might surprise you with how well it handles it, but it might also not handle it correctly at all. Lastly, and most importantly, it can drive by itself reliably like 95 to 98% of the time (by mileage or by time, whatever your metric is). Because of this, it is very easy to forget that it might occasionally (but exceedingly rarely) drive you 45 mph off the road. I put about 10 hours of FSD driving on before my first encounter with this. There were no warnings that it didn't understand the road, it just simply misread a lane. Stay alert. And keep your hands on the wheel!</p>

When I finally got the build pushed to my car I took it for a daily commute to the gym. Here's how it went. The profile is on Assertive btw. Driving through the neighborhood I understand it treats it as any other road but the car travels literally in the middle of the road so I have to disable it until I get out of neighborhood. Turning out of neighborhood the creep is so slow and when it finally decides to go after sitting for a little while with no cars coming, it's just too slow. Here's where I was pretty impressed at the 4 way stop sign, it does really well at detected when it's turn is but again it's commitment to go is just way to slow so I find myself always on the acceleration pedal to speed it along before someone honks at me. When entering a 2 lane left turn, it chose the one on the very left and what shocked me was it committed too hard and fast this time yanking me into the furthest lane. It then failed to correctly make the turn though. It also failed to make the turn at the light to my gym but that turn is a bit hard because of how sharp it is. I drive this commute every single day so I hope to see FSD grow enough to where I can actually babysit it and not intervene every second. I just wanted to share my experience with it and a bit of my disappointment as I've had FSD for around 3 years now.</p>

                     <p>Agree with everything you said. In addition to the center of the road neighborhood driving it goes too fast and accelerates too fast. I’ve tried all 3 settings and it turns and accelerates way too fast a lot. We have a lot of 45-50mph roads with 90 degree turns onto a 25mph road. It usually thinks hey it’s 100 yards away I better speed up and then at the last second take the turn at 40. It’s just way too aggressive when it needs to chill and way to chill when it needs to be aggressive. Blinking yellows freak it out too. Also has some weird turn behavior where it doesn’t use the turn signal all the time for me.</p><hr>
                     <p>Nope. I got the FSD Beta yesterday and it is rough. Tried to ram through a community gate at 30mph. Stopped and stalled out making an unprotected left turn. And just in general drives very very poorly in even the most basic of situations. I can see why they delayed pushing it out so long, but I am curious just how terrible the v8 and v9 FSD beta was if these are the orders of magnitude improvements we're seeing now because at this rate we'll need about 50 more of them before this thing matches regular autopilot.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sometimes I’m impressed by how it handles a straight and regular city street. Most times I am extremely mind bogglingly frustrated by how it decided to handle anything but a straight and regular street. I get that it’s beta, 100%, but this thing is not ready one bit. My recommendation to Tesla is to keep the beta group right where it’s at size-wise for 5-10 updates. With the NHTSA hot after regulation, this is not going to end well for Tesla or Tesla consumers if they keep expanding. I realized through the past few weeks of pain and torment w/ SS and now beta access that I bought the car because I like to zip around and genuinely love the tech it is really great at. I won’t be renewing my subscription come November.

I swerved back just as a car was trying to pass from behind and almost crashed. Going the wrong way down a one-way with traffic everywhere is about as dangerous as I’ve experienced so far. I am surprised there hasn’t been an accident yet. Be careful out there beta testers!</p>

It brakes well before a stop sign and then takes 5-7 seconds deciding if it wants to keep going, or stop and wait for any incoming cars. Cause the cars behind you to surely think you’re crazy. It also just missed a whole turn. I see why Elon is nervous about going wide with this release.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">59. Wow the FSD beta is really something! Some things I was very impressed with. Some things remind me this is definitely Beta. Overall the drive today made me realize just how hard a problem this is. May be one of the hardest EVER! There are so many things we take for granted when driving that now must somehow get quantified in a way that a computer system can accurately react to. It seems overwhelming hard actually. BUT chipping away at it bit by bit may be the best strategy. It is such a big problem that it HAS to be broken into bite size pieces. The system has come so far from when I got my car - when it was basically just lane holding cruise control. - The visualizations are incredible. It really gives an idea what has to be tracked - and I'm sure that there is plenty not displayed! - Four way stops were handled very well. - Works decent on dirt roads. - Works good at traffic light intersections. - In heavy traffic it works as good as can be expected. Guessing what other drivers are going to do is an intuitive skill. This is where the problem is HARD. For example a human may base decisions on not only the physics (speed, acceleration etc) of another car but also what that car did at the last intersection, what kind of car it is, what condition it is in and a 100 other factors we humans just do in the background. - You have to REALLY pay attention. Just like the "classic" FSD did in the early days this Beta can make a really wrong decision. And when this system decides to do something it can go about very decisively. I had one time where it quite aggressively turned toward a curb. For the sake of the future we must be very diligent. - When turning right or left and the other traffic does not stop it can take awhile to decide when to go. This is fine for me but people behind can get impatient. - The sensor set may need to be improved before the system can handle all situations. Would be cool if there was a camera up higher or farther forward so the system could gather data without having to "creep forward" This FSD thing is really a grand project. Millions of testers, a dedicated team, and a genius visionary working toward an incredible goal. Pushing the limits of regulation too. Will it ever 100% work in every situation? Maybe? Will it be WAY better than what we had - definitely yes. It is great to go along for the ride.

Phantom braking is absolutely bonkers now and lasts MUCH longer. Was driving on a 50mph road and it slowed down to 35mph (speed limit and setting still showed 50mph). Stayed at 35mph for about 10sec and then went back to 50mph. It also has HORRIBLE routing. Often when there's an upcoming left turn it'd get in the right lane when there's <.5mi to go. Then immediately freak out about not being able to get in the left lane to make the turn</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">61. Tested in a small town with light traffic and poorly marked roads. I'd give it a C. It failed to turn on a road with high speed traffic approaching despite no visibility issues. There was plenty of time to pull out but it didn't. It had a lot of trouble knowing where to drive due to some wide roads with no markings. I had to adjust the speed quite a bit. It got too close to one car on a turn and either bailed or I tugged too hard. The turns are not natural and it tended to start turning the opposite direction like it needed to make a really wide turn but it didn't. It also over accelerates in most cases after a turn. For the most part it got from point A to point B and there were some positives with giving peds space and stopping at all the stop signs.</p>

It’s horrible- not smooth, false warnings, doesn’t slow down for tight turns but slows down for no reason. If beta is good it should replace the public build which is not safe around town, in my opinion.</p>

                     <p>There is no public build for around-town use. It’s for limited-access roads and handles intersections only cursorily by means of obeying traffic controls only. Use it correctly and it’ll save you stress over thousands of miles of driving, as many of us will attest.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sorry for any confusion. I have the standard FSD, not the beta. I signed up for the beta and to provide input on my driving I’m using FSD much more than normal. I love it on the highway but on local roads I find it very unpleasant. When you mentioned turns I don’t mean turns at intersections. I mean curvy roads. When I’m driving 45 and the road has a tight bend ahead I slow down. But in my experience FSD doesn’t. My impression is that beta does slow down more like what a driver would do. I hope that clarifies.</p><hr>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">63. I’m in! Got the FSD beta downloaded and installed Yesterday morning! First drive was very good, even impressed the Mrs. For those who are waiting, I think I was a late first batch my score was 99 going into last Friday, but by Sunday night I was at 100. After a few takeovers and a ding for Autopilot disengagement (my passenger was FaceTiming during the drive, interior camera A.I. detected the phone and disengaged after 3 warnings, I kept rotating the steering wheel thinking it was checking if I was holding it, but it was due to the phone) my score was 99 late in the afternoon, by evening my safety score checking ability was removed from my app. No doubt the data is still being recorded by Tesla I enabled the enhanced FSD view in the settings, but in order for it to show you need to tap the compass top right corner of the map. This mornings ride was great, a couple jerky right turns, I think its the cars inability to see the lane markings clearly through the whole curve. Car bounced between a couple unnecessary lane changes before getting itself into the correct lane, downtown driving was smoother, probably due to the lower speed. FSD performs much better at lower speed, I have my AP speed limit offset set to -1, I use the scroll wheel constantly to adjust speed up or down, depending of my confidence level. I did notice a degradation in performance (A.I. confidence) during drives when the sun was low in the sky, shadows or glare may have something to do with that. One last point, may have been discussed, FSD does not recognize neighborhood entry gates, just a heads up.Looks as the 99’s will get the 10.3 soon, I’m looking forward to seeing what incremental improvements come with the next updates.</p>

                     <p>I can confirm that Beta FSD just stops at yellow blinking left turn arrows. They must not have those down in the Fremont CA area? They’re kind of a new thing here in Minnesota but they’ve been deployed for at least a couple of years. I reported it a couple of times to Tesla using the new report button in the screen.</p><hr>

A few times now after making a right turn, FSD chose to stay in the right most lane that ends up being a right turn only, thereby having to make an aggressive lane change to the left in the intersection to continue the route.</p>
