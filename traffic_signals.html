As more people get enrolled into the FSD Beta Program, here are a few (serious) limitations I wish I was aware before my first drive: It doesn't yet recognize speed bumps. Be prepared to brake. It nearly never responds correctly to blinking yellow lights and might jam on the brakes very hard in response. Be prepared to hit the accelerator. EDIT: 10.3 seems to have fixed this. I'm still boing to be more cautious around them, but then that's what a blinking yellow means, anyway! It doesn't seem to handle non-standard speed limit signs at all. I have many yellow speed limit signs around schools and curves in my area. Be prepared to slow down. Turns work great like 60-70% of the time. Maybe more. For the rest, be prepared to take over or give it a tap of the accelerator. Be ready to take over anytime you encounter construction or odd traffic conditions like non-90 degree intersections, railroad tracks, or anything that looks unusual. It might surprise you with how well it handles it, but it might also not handle it correctly at all. Lastly, and most importantly, it can drive by itself reliably like 95 to 98% of the time (by mileage or by time, whatever your metric is). Because of this, it is very easy to forget that it might occasionally (but exceedingly rarely) drive you 45 mph off the road. I put about 10 hours of FSD driving on before my first encounter with this. There were no warnings that it didn't understand the road, it just simply misread a lane. Stay alert. And keep your hands on the wheel!</p>

If the light turns yellow and it thinks you're not going to make it, it will lose it's mind with sound alerts and red warnings flashing on the screen. This also happens if it gets confused about road markings and thinks it's going to crash. Elon (Musk) said their criteria for getting into the FSD beta will depend on how you drive and whether or not the car is freaking out a bunch like I mentioned above. But the fact is that it's sometime unavoidable because the car is just overly-cautious sometimes. Full Self Driving for us regular folks is limited to single-road driving. Meaning, it will not turn from one street onto another or take you from point A to B. If you want into the beta, you gotta drive like a saint for "7 days." And access can be revoked any time even after it's granted.</p>

FSD is incredibly conservative with yellow lights, yet doesnâ€™t mind driving full speed until 3 car lengths away from a stopped car.</p>

I drove to the health club this morning (about a 10 minute drive) and then to work (about 15 minutes) using it. It did a lot better than I thought. On my first drive I couldn't engage it from my driveway, but I drove into the street in front of my driveway, and it drove me all the way to the roundabout at the club with no disengagements. Traffic was light, but I was impressed. It accelerated and braked a lot harder than I would have, but nothing unsafe. On the drive to work, it also did a fine job. There were only three things it did that were unusual. There was a stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet or so, and a side street to my left. It stopped 50 feet short and then said creeping up. The car that was at the stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet then moved forward, and so did my car to the stop sign. There was nobody behind me so I didn't disengage. There was also a time when I was at a stoplight and turning right onto a busy 3 lane highway. It crept forward, and although I would have gone, it continued to wait. I touched the accelerator to make the car go, and it did the rest of the route just fine. I probably didn't have to press the accelerator, but I didn't want to wait. It was creeping up to a stop sign, and someone stepped off the curb into the crosswalk ahead of me. It braked fairly hard (even though it was going less than 5MPH) and stopped short a few feet in front of the stop sign, even though it could have gone up to the marker safely. I guess better safe than sorry.It stopped AutoPilot at the street in front of work instead of going into the parking lot (the address entered was the official street address on the main street) so that seems right. There were no safety interventions, and like I said I was pretty impressed. I can see how incremental refinements will just make this better and better.</p>

Overall the drive today made me realize just how hard a problem this is. May be one of the hardest EVER! There are so many things we take for granted when driving that now must somehow get quantified in a way that a computer system can accurately react to. It seems overwhelming hard actually. BUT chipping away at it bit by bit may be the best strategy. It is such a big problem that it HAS to be broken into bite size pieces. The system has come so far from when I got my car - when it was basically just lane holding cruise control. - The visualizations are incredible. It really gives an idea what has to be tracked - and I'm sure that there is plenty not displayed! - Four way stops were handled very well. - Works decent on dirt roads. - Works good at traffic light intersections. - In heavy traffic it works as good as can be expected. Guessing what other drivers are going to do is an intuitive skill. This is where the problem is HARD. For example a human may base decisions on not only the physics (speed, acceleration etc) of another car but also what that car did at the last intersection, what kind of car it is, what condition it is in and a 100 other factors we humans just do in the background. - You have to REALLY pay attention. Just like the "classic" FSD did in the early days this Beta can make a really wrong decision. And when this system decides to do something it can go about very decisively. I had one time where it quite aggressively turned toward a curb. For the sake of the future we must be very diligent. - When turning right or left and the other traffic does not stop it can take awhile to decide when to go. This is fine for me but people behind can get impatient. - The sensor set may need to be improved before the system can handle all situations. Would be cool if there was a camera up higher or farther forward so the system could gather data without having to "creep forward" This FSD thing is really a grand project. Millions of testers, a dedicated team, and a genius visionary working toward an incredible goal. Pushing the limits of regulation too. Will it ever 100% work in every situation? Maybe? Will it be WAY better than what we had - definitely yes. It is great to go along for the ride.

With the excitement of getting the FSD Beta, I did not read the details before and thought it was going to replace the previous FSD automatically. What a difference now! I went from my home to my office with no interventions. It stopped roughly in front of blinking yellow lights and crossed over some solid white lines, but everything else was great.</p>

Iâ€™ve found that sometimes you just have to tap the accelerator pedal to coax it along when it gets too timid or just sits in place like it doesnâ€™t know what to do.</p>

                     <p>Remember that the reason why we're testing is to get more experiences in front of the software. I'm not surprised that my 15 mile roundtrip from our apartment in Fishers IN to Geist and back was filled with brake checks, poor lane choices and such. Interspersed with those were moments of sheer brillance. We're testers collecting more data to make FSD better. Those improvements will speed up as more data comes in with 1000+ more testers.</p><hr>
                     <p>It will be interesting to see if FSD gets better even without a software update. Tesla said in the past that our "driving mishaps " would be crunched up by its software and resulting AI improvements downloaded to the fleet.</p><hr>

Where I live, highway 160 south terminates at highway 4 where onramps will take you east or west on HW4. Each of these ramps has traffic control lights right before it puts you on the freeway. About 1000 feet before these traffic control lights, there are warning lights that will flash if traffic control is activated. 99% of the time I go through this, there is no traffic control so those warning lights are not lit. Until I just deactivated "traffic light and stop sign control", Ginger would phantom brake there EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm overly-ecstatic to report NOT ANYMORE!!!ðŸ˜€ IMO, future software updates should automatically turn that feature off as soon as you flip the switch for FSD. How do we make this happen?
